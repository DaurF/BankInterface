In short, our project is a bank interface, consisting of 5 classes and 4 interfaces

The account class is responsible for account properties such as name, UUID holder, and transaction. You can get the account ID, account balance, transaction history, and add a transaction 
Briefly, the "ATM" class is responsible for the program interface 
The bank class is responsible for bank data 
The transaction class is responsible for transactions. 
Ultimately, the User class is responsible for user data
